<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<ins> Stage 1: Intake <ins/>  

<p>

Every user issue has one thing in common...the necessity to contact someone to help. To do this, users need to report their issue, which in most cases comes in the form of creating a ticket. This is when we will intake the tickets that contain information about their issues. Below is a simple example of a user putting in a ticket. In this case, theyre reporting that their mobile banking system is down.

</p>
<p>
From here, agents will recieve the ticket on their end. Agents can access tickets assigned to them through:

Agent Portal > Tickets > Open > *Open Ticket*

Above is an agent view of the same ticket that the user created in the first image.

<ins> Stage 2: Assignment and Communication <ins/>
<p>

After a user creates a ticket and it is inside the ticketting system, it must be assigned to an agent and/or team. After that, communication with the required parties is necessary.

Below is an expanded view of the user's ticket.

After a ticket is observed, it will be assigned to an agent or team by a system admin or manager. Within this same page, we can assign an SLA to the ticket to ensure proper, defined service to the end user. Once the agent or team gets it assigned & the SLA is determined, then communication must begin. It is necessary to communicate within the ticket so both the end user and also anyone else with access to the ticket can be informed on any updates or changes within the ticket. 

Once communication is being established, then the ticket can be worked by whoever is in charge of it. 




<ins> Stage 3: Working the Issue <ins/>

<p>
At this stage, we want to be able to actually work the user's ticket so we can resolve their issue as quickly as possible.

<p>One final thing to note is that tickets can be made a plethora of ways. It could of course be simply done through the designated ticketting portal, however, that isnt always the case. Sometimes "tickets" appear in the form of emails, direct phonecalls, or even conversations with a coworker in the hall. It is always important to manually track and create tickets regardless of what they are. Metrics are important! :).  </p>
